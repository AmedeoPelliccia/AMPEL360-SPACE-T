# Stakeholder Entry Point — Operations (OPS)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K02** — conops-mission-phases → `K02_conops-mission-phases/`
- **K09** — infrastructure-permitting-jurisdiction → `K09_infrastructure-permitting-jurisdiction/`
- **K11** — human-factors-training-readiness → `K11_human-factors-training-readiness/`
- **K12** — nvh-metrics-corridors-exposure → `K12_nvh-metrics-corridors-exposure/`
- **K14** — reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health → `K14_reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
