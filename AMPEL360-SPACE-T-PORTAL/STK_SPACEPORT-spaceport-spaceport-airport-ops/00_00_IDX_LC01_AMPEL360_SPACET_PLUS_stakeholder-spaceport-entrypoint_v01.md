# Stakeholder Entry Point — Spaceport/Airport Ops (SPACEPORT)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K09** — infrastructure-permitting-jurisdiction → `K09_infrastructure-permitting-jurisdiction/`
- **K03** — hazmat-cryo-propellants-safety-case → `K03_hazmat-cryo-propellants-safety-case/`
- **K11** — human-factors-training-readiness → `K11_human-factors-training-readiness/`
- **K10** — industrialization-supplychain-quality → `K10_industrialization-supplychain-quality/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
