# Stakeholder Entry Point — Systems Engineering (SE)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K02** — conops-mission-phases → `K02_conops-mission-phases/`
- **K04** — integration-boundaries-and-icds → `K04_integration-boundaries-and-icds/`
- **K05** — model-fidelity-verification-credit → `K05_model-fidelity-verification-credit/`
- **K06** — data-governance-ssot-schemas-identifiers → `K06_data-governance-ssot-schemas-identifiers/`
- **K14** — reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health → `K14_reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
