# Stakeholder Entry Point — Certification & Authorities (CERT)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K01** — certification-authority-basis → `K01_certification-authority-basis/`
- **K05** — model-fidelity-verification-credit → `K05_model-fidelity-verification-credit/`
- **K10** — industrialization-supplychain-quality → `K10_industrialization-supplychain-quality/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
