# K01 ATA 00 Related Issues

## Purpose
Track GitHub issues that implement, modify, or provide evidence for **K01** activities affecting **ATA 00 (Program Governance)**.

## How to use (rules)
- One issue per row.
- Prefer repository-local links (issue numbers) where possible.
- If the issue is in another repo, use a full URL.
- Reference the affected **acceptance criteria (AC-00-XXX)** and/or **task IDs** (T001/T002, etc.) when known.
- Keep this list curated: close/remove duplicates, merge references into the canonical issue.
