# Stakeholder Entry Point — Configuration Management (CM)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K01** — certification-authority-basis → `K01_certification-authority-basis/`
- **K04** — integration-boundaries-and-icds → `K04_integration-boundaries-and-icds/`
- **K06** — data-governance-ssot-schemas-identifiers → `K06_data-governance-ssot-schemas-identifiers/`
- **K08** — dpp-sbom-provenance-scope → `K08_dpp-sbom-provenance-scope/`
- **K10** — industrialization-supplychain-quality → `K10_industrialization-supplychain-quality/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
