# K05 — model-fidelity-verification-credit
## ATA 27 — Flight Controls

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- What aeroservoelastic model fidelity is required for flight control certification?
- Can hardware-in-the-loop simulation earn verification credit for control system qualification?
- What test-analysis correlation is needed for control surface flutter and actuation loads?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define flight control model hierarchy (aeroservoelastic, actuation loads, flutter).
2. Establish model fidelity requirements for control law simulation.
3. Define verification credit proposal (HIL simulation vs. flight test).
4. Plan test campaign for control system model validation.
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Aeroservoelastic model description
- [ ] HIL simulation verification credit proposal
- [ ] Control surface flutter analysis plan
- [ ] Iron bird / integration test plan
