# K05 — model-fidelity-verification-credit
## ATA 57 — Wings / Lifting Surfaces

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- What aeroelastic model fidelity is required for wing flutter certification?
- What structural analysis methods apply to novel wing configurations (composite, morphing)?
- Can virtual testing (high-fidelity simulation) partially replace physical wing load testing?
- What test-analysis correlation criteria apply to wing static and fatigue testing?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define wing structural analysis model hierarchy (global aero-structural, detail stress, flutter).
2. Establish model fidelity requirements for aeroelastic analysis (CFD-CSM coupling).
3. Define verification credit proposal for wing certification (analysis vs. test).
4. Plan test campaign for model validation (ground vibration test, static test, flight flutter test).
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Aeroelastic model description and fidelity justification
- [ ] Verification credit proposal (analysis vs. test)
- [ ] Ground vibration test plan
- [ ] Wing static/fatigue test plan
