# K05 — model-fidelity-verification-credit
## ATA 32 — Landing Gear

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- What landing gear load model fidelity is required for drop test correlation?
- Can simulation replace some landing gear qualification tests (fatigue, endurance)?
- What model validation is needed for novel gear configurations (retraction, steering)?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define landing gear structural model hierarchy (loads, stress, fatigue).
2. Establish model fidelity requirements for drop test simulation.
3. Define verification credit proposal (simulation vs. physical drop/fatigue test).
4. Plan test-analysis correlation campaign for gear qualification.
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Landing gear loads model description
- [ ] Drop test simulation correlation plan
- [ ] Gear fatigue substantiation approach
- [ ] Verification credit proposal (analysis vs. test)
