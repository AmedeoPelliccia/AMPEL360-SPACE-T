# K05 — model-fidelity-verification-credit
## ATA 53 — Fuselage / Pressure Vessel

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- What FEA model fidelity is required for pressure vessel certification (global vs. detail models)?
- What fatigue & damage tolerance analysis philosophy applies to the composite fuselage?
- Can analysis earn verification credit or is full-scale static/fatigue testing mandatory?
- What test-analysis correlation criteria apply to pressure cycle simulation?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define FEA model hierarchy: global fuselage model, detail models (joints, cutouts, repairs).
2. Establish model fidelity requirements (mesh density, material modeling, boundary conditions).
3. Define verification credit proposal (analysis vs. test matrix for static, fatigue, DTA).
4. Plan test-analysis correlation campaign (coupon → element → component → full-scale).
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] FEA model description and fidelity justification
- [ ] Verification credit proposal (analysis vs. test)
- [ ] Test-analysis correlation plan
- [ ] Building block test matrix (coupon to full-scale)
