# Backlog Knot K11 — Human Factors & Training Readiness (PHM Scope)

## Problem Statement

Define human factors requirements and training readiness criteria for PHM hardware maintenance, assembly, and inspection activities. Establish ergonomic design requirements, maintenance access provisions, and training curricula for PHM-specific hardware handling.

## Scope Boundary
- In-scope: Maintenance access and ergonomics for PHM hardware, tooling requirements, training for hardware assembly/disassembly, human factors in inspection procedures
- Out-of-scope: Flight crew training (OPS AoR), digital training platforms (AI AoR)

## PHM ATA Impact Breakdown

| ATA | Chapter Title | K11 Relevance |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| 01 | Operations | Operational human factors |
| 09 | Towing and Taxiing | Ground handling ergonomics |
| 10 | Parking, Mooring, Storage | Hardware storage procedures |
| 11 | Placards and Markings | Safety markings for maintenance |
| 12 | Servicing | Servicing access and procedures |
| 18 | Vibration & Noise Analysis | Noise exposure during maintenance |
| 25 | Equipment / Furnishings | Interior access for maintenance |
| 44 | Cabin Systems | Cabin hardware maintenance access |
| 84 | Propellant Systems | Hazmat handling training |
| 112 | SpaceT Life Support | Life support hardware training |

## Tasks (minimum set)

1. Define maintenance access requirements for PHM hardware
2. Establish tooling and special equipment requirements
3. Define training curricula for PHM-specific hardware handling
4. Identify human factors risks in PHM maintenance procedures
5. Record decisions; update baseline and trace links

## Cross-Dependencies

- **OPS** — Operational training requirements
- **MRO** — Maintenance procedure alignment
- **SAF** — Human factors safety assessment
- **SPACEPORT** — Ground handling training

## Decision & Closure Criteria
- Decision owner: PHM + MRO leads
- Evidence required: Maintenance access study, training needs analysis, human factors risk assessment
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Maintenance access provisions verified for all PHM hardware
  - [ ] Training curricula defined for critical hardware activities
  - [ ] Human factors risks identified and mitigated
  - [ ] Baseline updated (CM)

## Pathways
1) Requirements/ConOps
2) Architecture/ICDs
3) Implementation/Industrialization
4) Verification/Qualification
5) Baseline & Release
