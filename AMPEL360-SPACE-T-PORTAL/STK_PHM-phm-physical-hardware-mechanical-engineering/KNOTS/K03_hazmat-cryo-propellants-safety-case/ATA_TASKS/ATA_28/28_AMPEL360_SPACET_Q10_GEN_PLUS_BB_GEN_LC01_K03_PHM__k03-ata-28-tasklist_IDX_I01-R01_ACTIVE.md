# K03 — hazmat-cryo-propellants-safety-case
## ATA 28 — Fuel / Propellant Systems

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- What cryo-material compatibility requirements apply to propellant tanks and distribution lines?
- What leak detection and containment integrity criteria apply to cryogenic propellants?
- What hazmat classification applies to novel propellant formulations?
- What fire/explosion protection is required for propellant handling hardware?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define ATA 28 hazmat scope: propellant types, containment hardware, distribution lines.
2. Establish cryo-material compatibility requirements for all propellant-wetted surfaces.
3. Define leak rate criteria and containment integrity requirements.
4. Map hazmat classification to propellant handling hardware.
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Material compatibility matrix (propellant-wetted surfaces)
- [ ] Leak rate criteria and test plan
- [ ] Hazmat classification mapping
- [ ] Fire/explosion protection design requirements
