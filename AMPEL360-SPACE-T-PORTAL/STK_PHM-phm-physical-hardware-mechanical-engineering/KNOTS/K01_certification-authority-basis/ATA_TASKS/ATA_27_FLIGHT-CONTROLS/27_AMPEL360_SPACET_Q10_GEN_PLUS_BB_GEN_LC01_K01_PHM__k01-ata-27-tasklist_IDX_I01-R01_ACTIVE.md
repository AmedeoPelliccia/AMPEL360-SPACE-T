# K01 — certification-authority-basis
## ATA 27 — Flight Controls

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- Which certification specification (CS 25.671-703 / ECSS-E-ST-60C) governs flight control actuation?
- What redundancy requirements apply to fly-by-wire control surfaces?
- Are equivalent safety findings needed for novel actuation mechanisms?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define ATA 27 scope: control surfaces, actuators, servos, flight control computers (hardware).
2. Map applicable requirements (CS 25.671 controllability, CS 25.672 stability augmentation).
3. Define means of compliance for control surface flutter, divergence, and fatigue.
4. Execute validation/verification planning for control system hardware.
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Applicable requirements mapping (CS/FAR/ECSS)
- [ ] Means of compliance proposal
- [ ] Flutter analysis plan
- [ ] Control surface fatigue substantiation plan
