# K01 — certification-authority-basis
## ATA 28 — Fuel / Propellant Systems

## Uncertainty to Resolve (ATA-specific)
- Which certification specification governs propellant containment (CS 25.963 / ECSS-E-ST-35C)?
- What leak rate criteria apply to cryogenic propellant tanks and distribution lines?
- Are equivalent safety findings needed for novel propellant containment designs?

## Tasks (minimum set)
1. Define ATA 28 scope: tanks, lines, valves, pumps, propellant management hardware.
2. Map applicable requirements (CS 25.963 fuel tank, CS 25.967 fuel tank installation).
3. Define means of compliance for containment integrity and crash survivability.
4. Execute validation/verification planning for propellant system hardware.
5. Record decision; update baseline and trace links.

## Evidence Package
- [ ] Applicable requirements mapping (CS/FAR/ECSS)
- [ ] Containment integrity analysis plan
- [ ] Crash survivability assessment plan
- [ ] Material compatibility matrix (propellant-wetted surfaces)
