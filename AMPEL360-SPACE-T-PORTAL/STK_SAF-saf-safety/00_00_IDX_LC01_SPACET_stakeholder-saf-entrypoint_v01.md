# Stakeholder Entry Point — Safety (SAF)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K01** — certification-authority-basis → `K01_certification-authority-basis/`
- **K03** — hazmat-cryo-propellants-safety-case → `K03_hazmat-cryo-propellants-safety-case/`
- **K05** — model-fidelity-verification-credit → `K05_model-fidelity-verification-credit/`
- **K11** — human-factors-training-readiness → `K11_human-factors-training-readiness/`
- **K12** — nvh-metrics-corridors-exposure → `K12_nvh-metrics-corridors-exposure/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
