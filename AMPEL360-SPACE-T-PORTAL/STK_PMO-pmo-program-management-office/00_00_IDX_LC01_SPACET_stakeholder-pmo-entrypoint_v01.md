# Stakeholder Entry Point — Program Management Office (PMO)

## Scope
This directory is the stakeholder-centric entry point. Work is organized by **Backlog Knots** (uncertainty knots).

## Active Backlog Knots

- **K01** — certification-authority-basis → `K01_certification-authority-basis/`
- **K02** — conops-mission-phases → `K02_conops-mission-phases/`
- **K10** — industrialization-supplychain-quality → `K10_industrialization-supplychain-quality/`
- **K14** — reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health → `K14_reliability-growth-maintenance-intervals-health/`

## Operating Model
- Each Knot has an **overview**, **ATA impact breakdown**, and **tasks** to close uncertainties.
- Tasks close with **Decision + Evidence**, then a baseline update (CM).
