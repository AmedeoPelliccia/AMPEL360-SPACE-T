# AMPEL360 Space-T: N-NEURAL_NETWORKS_DPP_TRACEABILITY Axis

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-09  
**Status:** Active  
**Baseline:** OPT-IN Framework Standard v1.1

---

## 1. Overview

The **N-NEURAL_NETWORKS_DPP_TRACEABILITY** axis encompasses all AI/ML systems, neural network architectures, digital product passport infrastructure, and certification-grade traceability for the AMPEL360 Space-T program. This axis provides the intelligent backbone connecting all other OPT-IN axes (O, P, T, I) through data-driven decision support, predictive capabilities, and immutable audit trails.

### 1.1 Key Objectives

- **AI-Augmented Operations**: Neural networks for flight control, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Real-time model synchronization with physical assets
- **Regulatory Compliance**: DO-178C/DO-254 adapted frameworks for AI/ML certification
- **Immutable Traceability**: Blockchain-anchored evidence chains for all lifecycle artifacts
- **Human-AI Teaming**: Explainable AI (XAI) for crew and ground operator decision support
