# KNU Reward Ledger Template
# ===========================
# CSV template for tracking KNU (Known Non-Unknowns) token rewards
# 
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this template to create a new reward ledger
#   2. Fill in the rows with KNU entry data
#   3. Run: python scripts/knu_token_distribution.py distribute --knot <KNOT_ID> --input <ledger.csv>
#
# Field Descriptions:
#   - knot_id: KNOT identifier (K01-K14)
#   - knu_id: Unique KNU identifier (format: KNU-{KNOT}-{PARTITION}-{SEQUENCE})
#   - owner: Person or team responsible for resolution
#   - E_pred: Predicted effort score (arbitrary units, normalized during calculation)
#   - dR_primary: Direct residue reduction in primary KNOT (0-100%)
#   - dR_adj_sum: Sum of residue reductions in adjacent KNOTs (0-100%)
#   - status: Current status (draft|submitted|in_review|accepted|merged|rejected)
#   - artifacts: Comma-separated list of artifact references (URLs, file paths, etc.)
#   - validated_by: Name of validator who confirmed impact
#   - validated_at: Validation timestamp (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
#   - weight: Calculated distribution weight (filled by script)
#   - tokens_awarded: Number of tokens awarded (filled by script)
#
# Eligibility Criteria (default):
#   - Status must be 'accepted' or 'merged'
#   - Must have at least one artifact
#   - Must be validated by an authorized reviewer
