## Glossary Entries

---

### A

**ATA**
: Air Transport Association. Numbering system for aerospace systems (e.g., ATA Chapter 24 = Electrical).

**Assurance Level**
: → See Development Assurance Level (DAL)

---

### B

**Baseline**
: A formally reviewed and agreed-upon configuration of an artifact, used as a reference for future changes.

---

### C

**Catastrophic**
: Failure condition classification. Effects that would prevent continued safe flight and landing. (DO-178C)

**Configuration Item (CI)**
: An aggregation of hardware, software, or both, that is designated for configuration management.

---

### D

**DAL (Development Assurance Level)**
: Classification assigned to software or hardware based on the severity of failure condition effects. Levels: A (most rigorous) through E (least rigorous).

**Derived Requirement**
: A requirement that is not directly traceable to a higher-level requirement but is generated from design, implementation, or verification considerations.

---

### E

**ECSS**
: European Cooperation for Space Standardization.

---

### F

**FHA (Functional Hazard Assessment)**
: A systematic analysis to identify and classify failure conditions based on their effects on the aircraft and crew. (SAE ARP4761)

**Failure Condition**
: A condition having an effect on the aircraft and/or its occupants, either direct or consequential, caused or contributed to by one or more failures.

---

### H

**Hazardous**
: Failure condition classification. Large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities. (DO-178C)

---

### M

**Major**
: Failure condition classification. Significant reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities. (DO-178C)

**Minor**
: Failure condition classification. Slight reduction in safety margins. (DO-178C)

---

### O

**OPT-IN Framework**
: Organization, Program, Technology, Infrastructure, Neural. Five-axis framework for AMPEL360 Space-T.

---

### P

**PSSA (Preliminary System Safety Assessment)**
: Safety assessment conducted during system development to verify that safety requirements are allocated and preliminary design meets safety objectives.

---

### R

**Root**
: In nomenclature, the 2-digit ATA chapter code (e.g., 00, 24, 72).

---

### S

**SSA (System Safety Assessment)**
: Final safety assessment demonstrating compliance with all safety requirements.

**Safety Requirement**
: A requirement derived from safety analysis to mitigate identified hazards.

---

### T

**Traceability**
: The ability to track relationships between artifacts throughout the development lifecycle.

**TYPE**
: In nomenclature, the artifact type code (e.g., PLAN, FHA, REQ).

---

### V

**Variant**
: In nomenclature, the configuration or baseline identifier (e.g., SPACET, LC02-SPACET).

**Verification**
: Process of determining that requirements are correctly implemented in the system.

**Validation**
: Process of determining that the system meets stakeholder needs and intended use.
