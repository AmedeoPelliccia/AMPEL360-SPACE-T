# Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)

## 1. System Function Analysis
Describe the functions being analyzed.

## 2. Failure Conditions List
| Function | Failure Condition | Phase | Effect (Crew/System) | Classification (Cat/Haz/Maj) | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Thrust Control | Total Loss of Thrust | Takeoff | Forced Landing | Hazardous | HAZ-001 |

## 3. Safety Objectives
Derived safety requirements based on the classification.
*   **SR-001:** The probability of "Total Loss of Thrust" shall be < 1E-7/fh.

## 4. Verification Strategy
How will these objectives be proven? (FTA, Testing, etc.)
