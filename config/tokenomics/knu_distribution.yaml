# KNU Token Distribution Configuration
# =====================================
# Version: 1.0
# Date: 2026-01-10
#
# Configuration for KNU (Known Non-Unknowns / Uncertainty Resolution Unit) 
# token distribution system. Defines parameters, eligibility criteria, 
# KNOT pools, and adjacency graph for spillover calculations.

version: "1.0"

# Distribution Parameters
# -----------------------
# Controls the weight of effort vs impact in token allocation
parameters:
  # α (alpha): Weight given to predicted effort
  # Formula: w_i = α·Ê_i + (1-α)·Î_i
  # Default: 0.30 means 30% effort, 70% impact
  alpha: 0.30
  
  # λ (lambda): Spillover multiplier for adjacent KNOT impact
  # Formula: S_i = Σ(a_k→j · ΔR_j,i) where spillover is worth λ * direct impact
  # Default: 0.50 means spillover worth 50% of direct impact
  lambda_spillover: 0.50

# Eligibility Criteria
# --------------------
# Defines requirements for KNU entries to qualify for token rewards
eligibility:
  # Required status values for reward eligibility
  required_status:
    - "accepted"
    - "merged"
  
  # Whether artifacts must be present for eligibility
  require_artifacts: true
  
  # Whether validation is required for eligibility
  require_validation: true

# KNOT Prize Pools
# ----------------
# Base token allocation per KNOT. Actual distribution depends on
# the number of eligible KNU entries and their weights.

# Adjacency Graph
# ---------------
# Defines spillover relationships between KNOTs
# Each entry represents: KNOT_source -> { KNOT_target: weight }
# Weight indicates strength of spillover effect (0.0-1.0)
#
# Based on KNOT uncertainty focus relationships:
# - Certification (K01) influences ConOps (K02) and Data governance (K06)
# - ConOps (K02) influences Certification (K01) and Human factors (K11)
# - Safety (K03) influences Operations (K02) and Human factors (K11)
# - Systems Engineering (K04, K05) influence multiple technical KNOTs
# - Data governance (K06) is foundational and influences many KNOTs
# - AI/ML (K07) influences Autonomy, Data, and Human factors
# - DPP (K08) influences Data governance and Supply chain
